          I started my career as a designer after technical school.
          Subsequently, I worked as a design assistant at an advertising agency,
          and then I began my undergrad. Since this time, I have had multiple
          experiences with graphic and digital design.

          I also spent some time in the US, studying Service Design. When I get
          back to Brazil I worked for small startups and two Brazilian unicorns,
          Stone payments, listed in Nasdaq, and VTEX, the biggest e-commerce
          platform in LATAM.
