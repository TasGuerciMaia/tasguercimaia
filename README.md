  Designer website
</h1>

This is my personal website, I made the design from scratch on figma and coded forking the [Gatsby starter default](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default). As a Designer that knows some code It was quite simple to put all toghether with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I also used [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/) to build my styles faster.  

This website is a work in progress, feel free to give feedbacks on fork the repository to build your own website. Also feel free to reach out to understend more about the design process behind this project. If you need to run this repository locally follow the steps on [Gatsby's docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/).
